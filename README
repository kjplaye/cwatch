C(olorized) Watch
------------------

We use edit-distance dynamic programs to find out which characters are changing.
An edit, an insert, or a delete counts as a change.  Changes are
represented by colors:

    RED  : Change occured     1 attempt ago, (just changed)
 YELLOW  : Change occured    10 attempts ago.
  GREEN  : Change occured   100 attempts ago.
   CYAN  : Change occured  1000 attempts ago.
MAGENTA  : Change occured 10000 attempts ago.

-d : You can change the default delay between commands.  Note that bigger
     strings will place higher demands on the CPU (and memory).  So there
     is a lower bound to how fast commands are executed.

-s -w -h : These values max_string, window_size and history.  They default to
           10000, 400, and 10000 respectively.  Set them lower or higher to use
	   less or more resources.
